Krispy Kreme

A project by Julie and KK

Premise:  Move around the city among neighborhoods to buy/sell drugs.  Make money, avoid the police! 


Create restful service(s) that:
1.  Tracks your location
2.  Tracks your cash and bank balances
3.  Tracks your drug quantities
4.  Generates drug sale and purchase prices based on neighborhood and potentially other factors like supply and demand
5.  Tracks police locations, arrests, and jail time
6.  Gaming service that manages turns, wins/losses, etc.
7.  Etc.

For the front end create:
1.  Command line format for submission and communication with the gaming service


What a simple interraction looks like:

Drive to Maywood
Menu
(list of drugs and their available quantity and price is displayed)
Buy 1000 Heroin
(display inventory and cash/bank balance)
Drive to Naperville
(display demand and prices for each drug)
Sell 1000 heroin
(display inventory and cash/bank balance)
...


Minimum viable product might include:
1.  Neighborhoods
2.  Drugs and a base buy/sell price
3.  Inventory and balances
4.  Moving between neighborhoods
5.  Determining win/loss
